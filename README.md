# 05-FPS-Maze
FPS Maze Game With Goals and Enemies

In this project I added:
A first person player controlled player with key and mouse.
A short maze for the player to navigate
Multiple use of constructive solid geometry
A key to pick up to unlock door
A Robot Enemy that can kill the player
Main Menu, In Game Menu, and End Game Screen
Music and Sound Effects
The Ability to remap and save keyboard controls
The Game has the Clear Objective of getting the key and reaching the end
Texture Maps for the walls 
Skybox

Reference: 
I used the demonstration videos as well as Kenney Assets, Free Music Websites, and A skybox Website.

Implementation: I used the videos and what I know thus far to creat a short playable 3d FPS level with Enemies, keys, and an exit
